Product Consultation,Compatibility of XDR-5000 Wireless Headset with Dell XPS 13,"Hi there,

I’m planning to purchase the XDR-5000 Wireless Headset and want to confirm if it will pair seamlessly with my Dell XPS 13 running Windows 11 Pro (build 22000). Do I need to install any special Bluetooth drivers or software to maintain high-quality audio? Also, does the headset support simultaneous connections to two devices?

Thanks for your help,

Product Consultation,Excited to buy ProMax 15 UltraBar—warranty question!,"Hello Support Team,

I’ve heard great things about the ProMax 15 UltraBar sound system and can’t wait to get one. The 2-year warranty sounds reassuring—could you let me know exactly what’s covered? For instance, would it replace the unit if I accidentally dropped it during setup or spilled water on it? Also, do you offer an optional 3-year extension?

Thanks a ton,

Product Consultation,Confused between ProCam S2 and S3—need real advice,"Good afternoon,

I’ve been researching the ProCam S2 and S3 digital cameras, but all the spec sheets sound like marketing fluff. Both claim 24 MP and 4K video—what actually makes the S3 worth €200 more? I need honest pros and cons on low-light performance and autofocus speed before I commit.

Frustrated,
